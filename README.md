Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package
management reproducible by building packages seperate from each other, declarative as it is unimportant to share projects and build environemntes within Nix, and reliable in being able to roll back to previous versions and ensuring packages do not break one another when installing or upgrading.  Please refer to the [Nix manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual)
for more details.
